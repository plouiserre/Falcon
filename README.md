# Falcon

I decided to create an html rendering engine

Important

For now you have only the begin of the rendering engine. You can play with this, modify but do not use in a production project.

## Features

I aim to build a complete, usable rendering engine for modern browser.

For the moment, I will do a lot of experimentation to find the best combination for building it. So the first version of the engine is in Dotnet.

This engine will be constitued by this librairies :

- DOMFalcon : an lib that extract a DOM from html page
- CSSOMFalcon : an lib that extract a CSSOM from html page

## How do I build and run this ?

In coming
